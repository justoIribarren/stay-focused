        "info-text-1": "The <a href=https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique target=_blank rel=noopener noreferrer >Pomodoro Technique</a> is a popular time management system that involves working/studying in 25-minute intervals with short 5-minute breaks in between to maximize focus. This technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s while he was a university student. He used a tomato-shaped timer from his kitchen to time himself. After repeated trial and error, tweaking the amount of time, he eventually put together the Pomodoro Technique.",
